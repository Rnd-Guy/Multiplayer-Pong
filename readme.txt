Multiplayer Pong!

Modules used: Pygame (GUI)
	      PyInstaller (Compile into .exe)

Current issues:
Game instantly closes unless run from command line



This is my attempt of using sockets to create a multiplayer game that connects over the internet. Game is server-hosted, so the server plays the game and the client gets the information from the server.
